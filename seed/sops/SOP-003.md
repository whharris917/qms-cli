# SOP-003: Deviation Management

---

## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes procedures for identifying, investigating, and resolving deviations from established procedures or expected product behavior, including root cause analysis and corrective/preventive actions.

---

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all deviations identified during development, including:

- **Procedural deviations:** A problem with a procedure as approved, or with the actual use of a procedure (e.g., procedure not followed, gap in procedure, error in effective procedure)
- **Product deviations:** A problem with the product itself (e.g., code bug, design flaw, unexpected behavior)

This SOP defines:
- When to create an Investigation (INV)
- Required structure and content of Investigations
- Root cause analysis requirements
- CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) management as execution items within INVs

---

## 3. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Deviation** | Departure from approved procedure or expected product behavior |
| **Procedural Deviation** | A problem with a procedure as approved, or with the actual use of a procedure |
| **Product Deviation** | A problem with the product itself (e.g., code bug, design flaw) |
| **Root Cause** | Fundamental reason for a deviation |
| **Corrective Action** | Action to eliminate the cause of an existing deviation and/or remediate the consequences of the deviation having occurred |
| **Preventive Action** | Action to eliminate the cause of a potential future deviation; continuous improvement of the QMS |
| **CAPA** | Corrective and Preventive Action — a category of execution item within an INV |
| **INV** | Investigation — an executable document for analyzing deviations |

---

## 4. When to Create an Investigation

Not all deviations require an Investigation. The Lead has discretion to determine when an INV is warranted.

### 4.1 General Guidance

**INV warranted when:**
- Root cause is not immediately obvious and requires investigational analysis
- Issue is systemic (not isolated)
- Problem is significant enough to require formal corrective/preventive actions

**INV not warranted when:**
- Root cause is obvious and fix is straightforward
- Isolated issue with no systemic implications
- Issue can be addressed directly via a CR without formal investigation

### 4.2 QA Oversight

QA provides oversight during review of all documents:

- When reviewing an INV, QA may determine "this INV is not needed" if the issue does not warrant formal investigation
- When reviewing a CR, QA may determine "this CR points to systemic issues that should be addressed via an investigation"

### 4.3 Role of Judgment

The judgment and discernment of all agents (human and AI) is integral to making the QMS function well. Not every scenario can be codified; appropriate application of these guidelines requires thoughtful assessment of each situation.

## 5. Investigation Content Requirements

Every Investigation shall include the following sections. Sections 1-6 constitute the pre-approved content (locked after pre-approval). Sections 7-10 are editable during execution.

### 5.1 Purpose

Why this investigation exists. What deviation or quality event triggered it.

### 5.2 Scope

Brief overview of affected system(s) or functionality. Include:

- **Context:** How the deviation was discovered, reference to triggering event or document
- **Deviation Type:** Procedural or Product (per Section 2)
- **Systems/Documents Affected:** List of impacted systems, files, or documents

### 5.3 Background

Context and circumstances of the deviation:

- What was expected to happen
- What actually happened
- When and how the deviation was discovered
- Timeline of events

### 5.4 Description of Deviation(s)

Full details of the deviation(s) being investigated:

- Facts and observations
- Documents reviewed
- System states observed
- Evidence collected

### 5.5 Impact Assessment

Assessment of deviation impact across domains:

- **Systems Affected:** Code, configuration, functionality
- **Documents Affected:** SOPs, specifications, other controlled documents
- **Other:** Users, workflows, external systems

### 5.6 Root Cause Analysis

Analysis to identify the fundamental cause(s) of the deviation.

Root cause analysis should identify the fundamental reason(s) for a deviation, distinguishing symptoms from underlying causes. The depth and methodology of RCA is left to the judgment of the investigator and reviewers. The goal is thoroughness appropriate to the deviation's significance.

### 5.7 Remediation Plan (CAPAs)

Corrective and preventive actions as execution items (see Section 6). May include:

- Execution item (EI) table with CAPA descriptions
- References to child CRs implementing specific changes

### 5.8 Execution Comments

Free-form observations, decisions, or issues encountered during CAPA execution. This section is also the appropriate place to attach VARs that apply to the INV as a whole.

### 5.9 Execution Summary

Overall narrative summarizing the CAPA execution after all EIs are complete. Include deviations from plan and final assessment.

### 5.10 References

Related documents including:

- Governing SOPs (SOP-001, SOP-003 at minimum)
- Triggering documents (if applicable)
- Child CRs implementing CAPAs

---

## 6. CAPAs as Execution Items

CAPAs are not standalone documents. They are execution items within Investigations, numbered as `INV-XYZ-CAPA-NNN`.

### 6.1 CAPA Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Corrective Action** | Eliminate the cause of an existing deviation and/or remediate the consequences of the deviation having occurred |
| **Preventive Action** | Eliminate the cause of a potential future deviation; continuous improvement of the QMS |

### 6.2 CAPA Requirements

- All INVs require CAPAs
- CAPAs do not exist outside of INVs
- If a problem is significant enough to require CAPAs, then an INV is needed

### 6.3 CAPA Implementation via Child CRs

CAPAs may spawn child CRs to implement specific changes. The parent-child relationship is tracked via document references.

**Quality Unit Responsibilities:**
- Ensure that child CRs reference their parent CAPAs
- Verify during INV post-review that CAPA child CRs are referenced in the CAPA execution item and confirmed as closed

### 6.4 CAPA Completion

A CAPA (as an EI in an INV) must be verified as complete by having its child CR(s) referenced in the EI and confirmed as closed. CAPA completion is a prerequisite to closure of the INV.

## 7. Investigation Workflow

Investigations follow the standard executable document workflow defined in SOP-002:

1. **Creation:** INV created in DRAFT status
2. **Pre-Review:** Route for review; QA and relevant parties review
3. **Pre-Approval:** Route for approval after successful review
4. **Execution:** Release for execution; CAPAs are implemented
5. **Post-Review:** Route for post-review after all CAPAs are complete
6. **Post-Approval:** Route for final approval
7. **Closure:** Close the INV

---

## 8. Closure Criteria

An INV may be closed when:

- Root cause(s) have been identified
- All CAPAs are complete (child CRs, if any, must be closed)
- Evidence is documented
- Post-review and post-approval are complete
