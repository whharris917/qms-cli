# SOP-001: Quality Management System - Document Control

---

## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the document control system for the project. It defines the structure, workflows, and requirements for creating, reviewing, approving, and maintaining controlled documents within the Quality Management System (QMS).

---

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all controlled documents within the the project QMS, including:

- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
- Change Records (CR)
- Investigations (INV)
- Test Protocols (TP)
- Exception Reports (ER)
- Variance Reports (VAR)
- System Development Lifecycle Documents (RS, RTM)

This SOP applies to all authorized users of the QMS, including human users and AI agents.

---

## 3. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **QMS** | Quality Management System - the document control infrastructure |
| **Controlled Document** | Any document managed under this SOP |
| **Responsible User** | The user who has checked out a document and owns its workflow |
| **Effective Version** | The approved version currently in force |
| **Draft** | A version under development, not yet approved |
| **Executable Document** | A document that authorizes implementation activities (CR, INV, TP, ER, VAR) |
| **Non-Executable Document** | A document that defines requirements or specifications (RS, RTM, SOP) |
| **Variance Report (VAR)** | Child document created when execution cannot proceed as planned; encapsulates resolution work for non-test executable documents (see SOP-004 Section 9A) |
| **Metadata** | Workflow state stored in .meta/ sidecar files |
| **Audit Trail** | Append-only event log stored in .audit/ JSONL files |

---

## 5. Three-Tier Metadata Architecture

The QMS uses a three-tier architecture to separate concerns between document content, workflow state, and audit history.

### 5.1 Tier 1: Document Frontmatter (Author-Maintained)

Documents contain minimal YAML frontmatter with only author-maintained fields:

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
revision_summary: Initial release
---
```

- **title**: Set at document creation, rarely changes
- **revision_summary**: Updated each revision cycle to describe changes. Should reference the authorizing CR ID when the revision is driven by a CR (e.g., `CR-004: Add traceability requirement`). This provides traceability to the change control record. Exceptions where CR ID is not required:
  - Initial document creation (v0.1)
  - Executable documents (CRs, INVs, etc.) which are self-authorizing
  - Revisions not driven by a specific CR

All other workflow state (version, status, responsible_user) is stored in sidecar files and injected when displaying documents.

### 5.2 Tier 2: Workflow State (.meta/ Sidecar Files)

Workflow state is stored in JSON sidecar files managed entirely by the QMS CLI:

```
QMS/.meta/{TYPE}/{DOC_ID}.json
```

Example `.meta/SOP/SOP-001.json`:
```json
{
  "doc_id": "SOP-001",
  "doc_type": "SOP",
  "version": "4.0",
  "status": "EFFECTIVE",
  "executable": false,
  "responsible_user": null,
  "checked_out": false,
  "checked_out_date": null,
  "effective_version": "3.0",
  "pending_assignees": []
}
```

**Responsible User Lifecycle:**
- Effective documents (vN.0): `responsible_user: null` — document is "unclaimed"
- On checkout: User who checks out becomes `responsible_user`
- Throughout vN.X (X>0): `responsible_user` persists even after checkin
- On approval: `responsible_user` returns to `null` — new effective version is "unclaimed"

### 5.3 Tier 3: Audit Trail (.audit/ JSONL Logs)

Complete audit history is stored in append-only JSONL files:

```
QMS/.audit/{TYPE}/{DOC_ID}.jsonl
```

Example `.audit/SOP/SOP-001.jsonl`:
```json
{"ts": "2026-01-02T10:30:00Z", "event": "CREATE", "user": "claude", "version": "0.1", "title": "Document Control"}
{"ts": "2026-01-02T12:00:00Z", "event": "CHECKIN", "user": "claude", "version": "0.1"}
{"ts": "2026-01-02T12:05:00Z", "event": "ROUTE_REVIEW", "user": "claude", "version": "0.1", "assignees": ["qa"]}
{"ts": "2026-01-02T13:00:00Z", "event": "REVIEW", "user": "qa", "version": "0.1", "outcome": "RECOMMEND", "comment": "Looks good."}
{"ts": "2026-01-02T14:00:00Z", "event": "APPROVE", "user": "qa", "version": "0.1"}
{"ts": "2026-01-02T14:05:00Z", "event": "EFFECTIVE", "user": "qa", "version": "1.0", "from_version": "0.1"}
```

**Event Types:**
| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| CREATE | Document created |
| CHECKOUT | Document checked out |
| CHECKIN | Document checked in |
| ROUTE_REVIEW | Routed for review |
| ROUTE_APPROVAL | Routed for approval |
| REVIEW | Review submitted (includes outcome and comment) |
| APPROVE | Approval submitted |
| REJECT | Rejection submitted (includes comment) |
| EFFECTIVE | Document became effective |
| RELEASE | Executable document released |
| REVERT | Reverted to execution |
| CLOSE | Executable document closed |
| RETIRE | Document retired |

**Comments Storage:**
- Review and rejection comments are stored ONLY in the audit trail
- Comments are attached to the version being reviewed (e.g., "0.1", "1.1")
- Use `qms comments {DOC_ID}` to view comments for the current version

### 5.4 Document Content Standards

Documents shall contain content only. The following metadata elements shall NOT be manually inserted into document bodies:

- Version numbers
- Effective dates
- Responsible user identifiers
- Revision history tables

All such metadata is managed by the QMS and available through:
- `python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} status {DOC_ID}` — Current version, status, responsible user
- `python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} history {DOC_ID}` — Complete revision history with timestamps

**Exception:** The `revision_summary` field in document frontmatter is author-maintained and describes the changes in the current revision cycle.

**Rationale:** Manually-maintained metadata creates opportunities for inconsistency between document content and authoritative sidecar files. The three-tier architecture ensures a single source of truth for all workflow metadata.

### 6.1 Document Naming Convention

| Document Type | Format | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Standard Operating Procedure | SOP-NNN | SOP-001 |
| Change Record | CR-NNN | CR-005 |
| Investigation | INV-NNN | INV-001 |
| CAPA (child of INV) | INV-NNN-CAPA-NNN | INV-001-CAPA-002 |
| Test Protocol (child of CR) | CR-NNN-TP | CR-005-TP |
| Exception Report (child of TC) | {PARENT}-ER-NNN | TP-001-TC-001-ER-001 |
| Variance Report (child of CR/INV) | {PARENT}-VAR-NNN | CR-014-VAR-001 |
| Template | TEMPLATE-{NAME} | TEMPLATE-CR |
| Requirements Specification | SDLC-FLOW-RS | SDLC-FLOW-RS |
| Requirements Traceability Matrix | SDLC-FLOW-RTM | SDLC-FLOW-RTM |

### 6.2 File Naming

| State | Filename |
|-------|----------|
| Effective version | `{DOC_ID}.md` |
| Draft version | `{DOC_ID}-draft.md` |
| Archived version | `{DOC_ID}-v{N.X}.md` |

**Examples:**
- `SOP-001.md` — Effective version of SOP-001
- `SOP-001-draft.md` — Draft version being revised
- `.archive/SOP/SOP-001-v1.0.md` — Archived version 1.0

---

## 7. Version Control

### 7.1 Version Numbering

Versions follow the format `N.X` where:

- **N** = Approval number (major version)
- **X** = Revision number within approval cycle (minor version)

| Version | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| v0.1 | Initial draft (never approved) |
| v0.2, v0.3... | Revisions during initial review cycle |
| v1.0 | First approval |
| v1.1, v1.2... | Revisions after re-opening v1.0 |
| v2.0 | Second approval |
| vN.0 | Nth approval |
| vN.X | Xth revision toward approval N+1 |

### 7.2 Version Transitions

| Action | Version Change |
|--------|----------------|
| Create new document | → v0.1 |
| Revise during review | v0.X → v0.(X+1) |
| First approval | v0.X → v1.0 |
| Re-open effective document | vN.0 → vN.1 |
| Subsequent approval | vN.X → v(N+1).0 |

### 7.3 Archive Management

When a document version is superseded:

1. The previous version is copied to `.archive/{TYPE}/`
2. The archive copy is renamed to include the version: `{DOC_ID}-v{N.X}.md`
3. The working directory retains only the current effective and/or draft versions

---

## 8. Document Status

| DRAFT | Document is being created or revised |
| IN_REVIEW | Document is routed for review |
| REVIEWED | All assigned reviews are complete |
| IN_APPROVAL | Document is routed for approval |
| APPROVED | All assigned approvals are complete |
| EFFECTIVE | Document is approved and in force |
| SUPERSEDED | Document has been replaced by a newer version |
| RETIRED | Document has been permanently retired (see Section 9.7) |

### 8.2 Executable Documents (CR, INV, TP, ER, VAR)

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DRAFT | Document is being created or revised |
| IN_PRE_REVIEW | Document is routed for pre-execution review |
| PRE_REVIEWED | All pre-reviews are complete |
| IN_PRE_APPROVAL | Document is routed for pre-execution approval |
| PRE_APPROVED | Document is approved for execution |
| IN_EXECUTION | Implementation/execution is in progress |
| IN_POST_REVIEW | Document is routed for post-execution review |

### 8.3 Terminal States

The following states are terminal—no further transitions are possible:

| Status | Applies To | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| SUPERSEDED | Non-executable | Replaced by newer version |
| CLOSED | Executable | Execution complete, no further action |
| RETIRED | All | Permanently archived, no longer in use |

---

## 9. Workflows

### 9.1 Review Workflow

Reviews must precede all approvals. Multiple review rounds are permitted.

**Initiating Review:**
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --review
```

For executable documents, the CLI automatically infers pre-review vs post-review based on the document's current status (DRAFT → pre-review, IN_EXECUTION → post-review).

QA is automatically assigned when a document is routed. QA then assigns Technical Units as needed:
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user qa assign {DOC_ID} --assignees reviewer1 reviewer2   # QA assigns additional reviewers
```

**Completing Review:**
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} review {DOC_ID} --recommend --comment "Looks good"
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} review {DOC_ID} --request-updates --comment "Changes needed"
```

Review outcomes:
- `--recommend`: Reviewer approves proceeding to approval stage
- `--request-updates`: Reviewer requires changes before approval

**Automatic Transition:** When all assigned reviewers complete their reviews, status transitions automatically:
- IN_REVIEW → REVIEWED
- IN_PRE_REVIEW → PRE_REVIEWED
- IN_POST_REVIEW → POST_REVIEWED

### 9.2 Approval Workflow

Approvals may only be initiated after review is complete AND all reviewers have `--recommend` outcome.

**Approval Gate:** The system blocks approval routing if any reviewer submitted `--request-updates`. The initiator must address the requested changes and route for another review round.

**Initiating Approval:**
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --approval
```

For executable documents, the CLI automatically infers pre-approval vs post-approval based on the document's current status (PRE_REVIEWED → pre-approval, POST_REVIEWED → post-approval).

The same Review Team (QA + assigned TUs) remains assigned for approval.

**Approving:**
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} approve {DOC_ID}
```

**Rejecting:**
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} reject {DOC_ID} --comment "Rejection rationale"
```

**Automatic Transitions:**
- All approvals complete: IN_APPROVAL → APPROVED, IN_PRE_APPROVAL → PRE_APPROVED, etc.
- Any rejection: Returns to previous REVIEWED state for revision

### 9.3 Rejection Handling

When any approver rejects a document:

| From Status | Transitions To | Required Action |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| IN_APPROVAL | REVIEWED | Revise, then re-route for review |
| IN_PRE_APPROVAL | PRE_REVIEWED | Revise, then re-route for pre-review |
| IN_POST_APPROVAL | POST_REVIEWED | Revise, then re-route for post-review |

The Responsible User must:
1. Address rejection comments
2. Check in the revised document
3. Route for another review cycle before re-routing for approval

### 9.4 Release Workflow (Executable Documents Only)

After pre-approval, executable documents must be manually released:

```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} release {DOC_ID}
```

This transitions the document from PRE_APPROVED to IN_EXECUTION.

### 9.5 Revert Workflow (Executable Documents Only)

If problems are discovered after post-review, the document may revert to execution:

```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} revert {DOC_ID} --reason "Reason for revert"
```

This transitions from POST_REVIEWED back to IN_EXECUTION.

### 9.6 Close Workflow (Executable Documents Only)

After post-approval, executable documents must be manually closed:

```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} close {DOC_ID}
```

### 9.7 Cancel and Retire Workflows

Documents may be removed from active use via two mechanisms depending on whether they were ever effective.

#### 9.7.1 Cancel (Never-Effective Documents)

Documents that have never been approved (version < 1.0) may be permanently canceled:

```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} cancel {DOC_ID} --confirm
```

**Requirements:**
- Document version must be < 1.0 (never approved/effective)
- Document must not be checked out
- Only Initiators (lead, claude) may cancel documents
- The `--confirm` flag is required

**Effects:**
- Document file is permanently deleted
- Metadata file (.meta/) is permanently deleted
- Audit trail (.audit/) is permanently deleted
- Document ID is freed for reuse

**Use Case:** Abandoning draft documents that will not be completed (e.g., duplicate CRs, test documents, false starts).

#### 9.7.2 Retire (Once-Effective Documents)

Documents that have been effective at any point (version ≥ 1.0) cannot be deleted—they have driven workflows and must remain in the archive. Instead, they are retired through a formal approval process:

**Step 1: Checkout and Edit**
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} checkout {DOC_ID}
```

Edit the document to replace content with a retirement notice, e.g.:
```markdown
# {DOC_ID}: [Title] - RETIRED

This document has been retired as of [date].

**Reason for Retirement:** [Brief explanation]

**Superseded By:** [If applicable, reference replacement document]
```

**Step 2: Check In and Route for Review**
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} checkin {DOC_ID}
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --review
```

Reviewers verify that retirement is appropriate.

**Step 3: Route for Retirement Approval**
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --approval --retire
```

The `--retire` flag signals that this approval leads to RETIRED status rather than EFFECTIVE.

**Step 4: Approval**
```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user qa approve {DOC_ID}
```

**Effects on Approval:**
- Document is archived to `.archive/{TYPE}/{DOC_ID}-v{VERSION}.md`
- Working copy is deleted from the QMS directory
- Status becomes RETIRED (terminal state)
- RETIRE event is logged to audit trail

**Use Case:** Permanently archiving obsolete procedures, superseded specifications, or completed executable documents that should no longer be used.

Note: The CLI infers pre/post phase from the document's current status. `--review` from DRAFT routes to IN_PRE_REVIEW; from IN_EXECUTION routes to IN_POST_REVIEW. Similarly for `--approval`.

## 11. Check-Out / Check-In

### 11.1 Check-Out

To edit a document, a user must check it out:

```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} checkout {DOC_ID}
```

Effects:
1. If an effective version exists, creates a new draft at version N.1
2. Document is copied to user's workspace
3. User becomes Responsible User (recorded in .meta file)
4. Document is locked; other users cannot edit

### 11.2 Check-In

To save changes back to the QMS:

```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} checkin {DOC_ID}
```

Effects:
1. Document is copied from workspace to QMS working directory
2. Previous draft version (if any) is archived
3. User remains Responsible User until approval

### 11.3 Reading Documents

Any user may read documents without checking out:

```
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} read {DOC_ID}                    # Latest effective version
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} read {DOC_ID} --draft            # Current draft
python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} read {DOC_ID} --version N.X      # Specific archived version
```

---

## 12. User Workspaces and Inboxes

### 12.1 Workspace

Each user has a workspace at `.claude/users/{username}/workspace/`

- Contains documents checked out by that user
- Only the workspace owner may edit documents within
- Documents must be checked in to be visible to others

### 12.2 Inbox

Each user has an inbox at `.claude/users/{username}/inbox/`

- Contains task files for assigned reviews and approvals
- Tasks are automatically created when documents are routed
- Tasks are removed when the user completes the action

**Task File Format:**
```yaml
---
task_id: task-CR-005-pre_review-v0-1
task_type: REVIEW
workflow_type: PRE_REVIEW
doc_id: CR-005
assigned_by: claude
assigned_date: 2026-01-02
version: 0.1
---

Please review CR-005 for technical accuracy.
```

---

## 13. CLI Command Reference
