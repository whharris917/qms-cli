# SOP-002: Change Control

---

## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure establishes the change control process for the project. It defines the requirements for initiating, documenting, reviewing, and approving changes within the Quality Management System.

---

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all changes within the project, including:

- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
- Source code and configuration
- System architecture and design
- User interface and user experience
- Documentation

**All changes require a Change Record (CR).** No exceptions.

---

## 3. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **CR** | Change Record - the controlled document authorizing a change |
| **TP** | Test Protocol - optional document detailing test procedures for a CR |
| **QA** | Quality Assurance Representative - mandatory reviewer and approver |
| **TU** | Technical Unit - domain expert assigned by QA to review technical changes |
| **Review Team** | QA plus any TUs assigned to a CR; this team remains consistent throughout the CR lifecycle |

---

## 4. Responsibilities

### 4.1 Change Initiator

The user initiating a change shall:

- Create a CR documenting the proposed change
- Provide all required content per Section 6
- Address reviewer comments
- Execute the change after pre-approval
- Document execution results for post-review

### 4.2 QA Representative

QA shall:

- Review all CRs for procedural compliance
- Determine which TUs (if any) must join the Review Team for each CR
- Determine if a Test Protocol (TP) is required
- Serve as mandatory member of the Review Team

### 4.3 Review Team

The Review Team (QA + assigned TUs) shall:

- Remain consistent throughout the CR lifecycle
- Participate in both pre-review and post-review
- Participate in both pre-approval and post-approval
- Verify the change is well-defined (pre) and correctly implemented (post)

---

## 5. CR Numbering

Change Records use sequential numbering:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| CR-NNN | CR-001, CR-002, CR-003 |

Numbers are assigned in order of creation.

**ID Reuse Policy:**
- IDs for documents that complete their workflow (CLOSED, RETIRED) are **never reused**
- IDs for canceled documents (never-effective, v < 1.0) are **freed for reuse** per SOP-001 Section 9.7.1

---

## 6. CR Content Requirements

Every Change Record shall include the following sections. Sections 1-9 constitute the pre-approved content (locked after pre-approval). Sections 10-13 are editable during execution.

### 6.1 Purpose

What problem does this CR solve? What improvement does it introduce?

### 6.2 Scope

Brief overview of affected system(s) or functionality. Include:

- **Context:** Reference to parent document (INV, CAPA) if applicable, or origin of the change
- **Changes Summary:** High-level description of what will change
- **Files Affected:** List of files/documents to be modified or created

### 6.3 Current State

Concise declarative statement(s) describing what exists now. Use present tense.

### 6.4 Proposed State

Concise declarative statement(s) describing what will exist after the change. Use present tense.

### 6.5 Change Description

Full technical details of the change. Structure is flexible based on complexity—may include subsections, diagrams, code snippets, or other explanatory content as needed.

### 6.6 Justification

Why is this change needed? Explain:

- The problem being solved or improvement being made
- Impact of not making this change
- How the proposed solution addresses the root cause

### 6.7 Impact Assessment

Assessment of change impact across domains:

- **Files Affected:** Code files, configuration files
- **Documents Affected:** SOPs, specifications, other controlled documents
- **Other:** External systems, interfaces, dependencies

### 6.8 Testing Summary

Brief description of how the implementation will be verified. This need not be exhaustive; if QA determines comprehensive testing is required, a separate Test Protocol (TP) will be created.

Examples:
- "Manual verification of corrected frontmatter fields"
- "Unit tests for new function; integration test for workflow"
- "Visual inspection of UI changes across supported resolutions"

### 6.9 Implementation Plan

Detailed plan for executing the change. May include:

- Execution item (EI) table with task descriptions
- Sequenced steps organized by component or area
- Dependencies between tasks

### 6.10 Execution

The executable block containing:

- **EI Table:** Task descriptions, execution summaries, outcomes, signatures
- **Execution Comments:** Free-form observations, decisions, VAR attachments

Per SOP-004, each EI has a Task Outcome of Pass or Fail. Failed tasks require a VAR attachment.

### 6.11 Execution Summary

Overall narrative summarizing the execution after all EIs are complete. Include deviations from plan and final assessment.

### 6.12 References

Related documents including:

- Governing SOPs (SOP-001, SOP-002 at minimum)
- Parent documents (INV, CAPA if applicable)
- Related CRs or other controlled documents

---

## 7. CR Workflow

Change Records follow the executable document workflow defined in SOP-001.

### 7.1 Review Team Assignment

When a CR is routed for pre-review, QA determines the Review Team composition:

- QA is always included
- TUs are assigned based on the technical domains affected by the change

This team remains assigned for all subsequent workflow stages.

### 7.2 Execution

After pre-approval, the change initiator:

1. Releases the CR for execution (`qms release`)
2. Implements the change as documented
3. Performs testing as described in the CR
4. Documents results in the CR

### 7.3 Post-Review Requirements

A CR may only be routed for post-review when **all** of the following conditions are met:

1. **Execution Complete:** All execution items have Task Outcome of Pass, or Fail outcomes are documented via Variance Report (VAR) per SOP-004 Section 9A

2. **Blocking VARs Resolved:** All Type 1 VARs must be fully closed; Type 2 VARs must be at least pre-approved

3. **Documentation Approved:** Any controlled documents (SOPs, specifications) modified under the CR have completed their own review/approval workflows and are EFFECTIVE

4. **Evidence Documented:** Completion evidence is recorded in the CR's Execution Summary column

**QA Post-Review Verification:**

During post-review, the QA representative shall verify:

- All execution items show Task Outcome of Pass, or Fail with attached VAR
- All Type 1 VARs are closed; all Type 2 VARs are at least pre-approved
- Any SOPs or controlled documents listed in scope are EFFECTIVE (not DRAFT or IN_REVIEW)
- The CR's revision_summary requirements (Section 8) have been applied to modified documents

If any condition is not met, QA shall submit review with `--request-updates` and document the deficiency.

---

## 8. Document Traceability

Document revisions driven by a Change Record should reference the CR ID in their `revision_summary` frontmatter field for traceability.

**Recommended Format:**
```yaml
revision_summary: Initial release
```

**Example:**
```yaml
revision_summary: Initial release
```

**Benefits of CR ID references:**
- Establishes a clear link between document changes and their authorizing CRs
- Enables audit trails from any document revision back to the change control record
- Provides context (rationale, approvers, testing) for any historical revision

**When CR ID is not required:**
- Initial document creation (v0.1)
- Executable documents (CRs, INVs, TPs, ERs, VARs) which are self-authorizing
- Revisions not driven by a specific CR
- Documents created before this policy took effect

---

## 9. Test Protocol (TP)

If QA determines that a CR requires comprehensive testing, a Test Protocol shall be created as a child document of the CR.

| Parent | Child |
|--------|-------|
| CR-001 | CR-001-TP |
| CR-015 | CR-015-TP |

The TP follows its own executable workflow and must be closed before the parent CR can be closed.

---

## 10. Rollback

All changes are tracked in git. If a change must be reverted:

1. Create a new CR documenting the rollback
2. Reference the original CR being reverted
3. Execute the rollback using git commands
4. Follow the standard CR workflow
