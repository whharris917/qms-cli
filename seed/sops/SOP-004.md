# SOP-004: Document Execution

---

## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) governs the execution phase of all executable documents, including scope management, progress tracking, and evidence requirements.

---

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to the execution phase of:

- Change Records (CR)
- Investigations (INV)
- Test Protocols (TP)
- Exception Reports (ER)
- Variance Reports (VAR)

Note: CAPAs are not standalone documents; they are execution items within INVs (see SOP-003).

---

## 3. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Executable Document** | A document that authorizes implementation activities (CR, INV, TP, ER, VAR) |
| **Executable Block** | Section of an executable document where implementation work is recorded |
| **Execution Item (EI)** | Discrete unit of work within the executable block |
| **Evidence** | Documentation proving completion of an execution item |
| **Static Field** | A field in the executable block that is defined at document creation and is never editable (e.g., test step instructions) |
| **Editable Field** | A field in the executable block where execution work is recorded (e.g., execution details, evidence) |

---

## 4. The Executable Block

### 4.1 Structure

The executable block is located after pre-approved content (Purpose, Scope, Rationale, Plan) in an executable document.

The executable block contains:
- **Static fields:** Defined at document creation; never editable (e.g., test step instructions, task descriptions)
- **Editable fields:** Where execution work is recorded (e.g., execution summary, task outcome, signature)

### 4.2 Execution Item Table

Execution items are tracked in table format with the following columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **EI** | Static | Execution item identifier |
| **Task Description** | Static | What the item accomplishes |
| **Execution Summary** | Editable | Narrative of work performed, evidence, observations |
| **Task Outcome** | Editable | Pass or Fail |
| **Performed By — Date** | Editable | Signature of executor with date |

**Task Outcome Values:**

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Pass** | Task completed as planned |
| **Fail** | Task could not be completed as planned; requires VAR or ER |

If a task outcome is Fail, the executor must attach a Variance Report (VAR) for non-test documents or Exception Report (ER) for test documents explaining why the task failed and how the situation will be resolved.

---

## 5. Document States During Execution

The executable block's editable fields change state as the document progresses:

| State | Executable Block (Editable Fields) | Pre-Approved Content |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **PRE_APPROVED** | Blank and locked | Locked |
| **IN_EXECUTION** | Editable | Locked |
| **POST_REVIEWED** | Editable (during review cycles) | Locked |
| **CLOSED** | Sealed | Sealed |

Note: The executable block structure (static fields) exists from document creation. Only the editable fields change state as described above.

---

## 6. Scope Integrity

Pre-approved scope items must be completed. This is a key lesson from INV-001.

### 6.1 Handling Obstacles

If obstacles arise during execution:

1. **Complete the item as planned**, OR
2. **Document an exception** via VAR (for non-test documents) or ER (for test documents) with rationale explaining why the item cannot be completed and how the situation will be resolved

### 6.2 Critical Principle

"Different execution mechanism" is NOT a scope exclusion. If scope was approved, it must be addressed.

Scope items cannot be silently dropped. If an item cannot be completed as originally planned, this must be formally documented with clear rationale and resolution path.

---

## 7. Execution Outcome Documentation

### 7.1 Recording Outcomes

As each execution item is completed, the executor shall:

1. Record a narrative of work performed in the **Execution Summary** column
2. Mark the **Task Outcome** as Pass or Fail
3. Sign with **Performed By — Date**

### 7.2 Pass Outcomes

A Pass outcome indicates the task was completed as planned. The Execution Summary should contain sufficient evidence to demonstrate completion, such as:
- Commit hashes (for code changes)
- Document IDs (for document creation/updates)
- Test results (for testing activities)
- Other verifiable artifacts appropriate to the task

### 7.3 Fail Outcomes

A Fail outcome indicates the task could not be completed as planned. When marking Fail:

1. Document what occurred in the Execution Summary
2. Attach a VAR (for non-test documents) or ER (for test documents) with:
   - Detailed description of the issue
   - Root cause analysis
   - Resolution plan or disposition

---

## 8. Evidence Requirements

### 8.1 Evidence in Execution Summary

Each Pass execution item requires documented evidence in the Execution Summary column. Evidence demonstrates that the work was performed and the objective was achieved.

### 8.2 Evidence Types

Acceptable evidence includes:
- Commit hash (for code changes)
- Document ID (for document creation/updates)
- Test result (for testing activities)
- Screenshot (for visual verification)
- Other verifiable artifacts appropriate to the execution item

### 8.3 Fail Items

Fail items require:
- Explanation of what occurred in the Execution Summary
- Attached VAR (for non-test) or ER (for test) per Sections 9 and 9A

---

## 9. Exception Reports (ER)

Exception Reports (ERs) are used specifically for **test execution failures** within Test Protocols (TPs) and Test Cases (TCs).

### 9.1 ER Scope

ERs apply only to:
- Test step failures (Actual Result does not match Expected Result)
- Test case failures
- Test protocol execution issues

For execution failures in non-test documents (CRs, INVs), use Variance Reports (VARs) per Section 9A.

### 9.2 ER Content

An Exception Report shall contain:
- **Exception Identification:** Parent document, failed item, exception type
- **Detailed Description:** What happened vs. what was expected
- **Root Cause:** Why the failure occurred
- **Proposed Corrective Action:** What action will be taken to address the failure
- **Exception Type:** Test Script Error, Test Execution Error, System Error, Documentation Error, or Other
- **Re-test Section:** Full re-execution of the test case (not just the failed step)
- **ER Closure:** Final outcome and disposition

### 9.3 Re-execution Requirement

When a test step fails:
1. Mark subsequent steps as N/A with ER reference
2. Create an ER containing a full re-execution of the test case
3. Re-execute the entire test within the ER (because the test script itself may be defective)
4. ER closure indicates Pass (all steps pass on re-test) or Fail (further action required)

### 9.4 Nested ERs

If re-execution within an ER fails, create a nested ER (e.g., TP-001-TC-001-ER-001-ER-001).

---

## 9A. Variance Reports (VAR)

Variance Reports (VARs) are used for **execution failures in non-test documents** (CRs, INVs). VARs are blocking child containers that encapsulate resolution work without cluttering the parent document.

### 9A.1 VAR vs ER vs INV

| Document | Use Case | Timing |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **ER** | Test execution failures (TC/TP) | During test execution |
| **VAR** | Non-test execution failures (CR/INV) | During execution of any non-test executable |
| **INV** | Post-hoc quality events, nonconformances | After discovery of quality issue |

**Key Distinction:** VARs handle exceptions encountered *during* execution of a pre-approved plan. INVs (per SOP-003) handle quality events discovered *after* the fact that require formal investigation.

### 9A.2 VAR Types

VARs have two types that govern how they clear the block on their parent document:

| Type | Block Release | Use When |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Type 1** | Full closure of VAR required | Resolution is critical to parent objectives; parent cannot meaningfully close until fix is proven |
| **Type 2** | Pre-approval of VAR sufficient | Impact is contained; parent's core objectives are met; VAR prevents follow-up from "falling off radar" |

**Type 2 Rationale:** Type 2 VARs enable the parent document to close efficiently while ensuring follow-up work is formally tracked. The VAR provides a dedicated container for work that is logically tied to the parent but would otherwise keep the parent open inefficiently.

### 9A.3 VAR Content

A Variance Report shall contain:
- **Variance Identification:** Parent document, failed item, VAR type
- **Detailed Description:** What happened vs. what was planned
- **Root Cause:** Why the variance occurred
- **Variance Type:** Execution Error, Scope Error, System Error, Documentation Error, External Factor, or Other
- **Impact Assessment:** Effect on parent document objectives
- **Proposed Resolution:** How the variance will be addressed
- **Resolution Work:** Executed work to resolve (uses same EI table structure as parent)
- **VAR Closure:** Final outcome and disposition

### 9A.4 VAR Naming

VARs are children of their parent document:

| Parent | VAR ID |
|--------|--------|
| CR-014 | CR-014-VAR-001 |
| INV-003 | INV-003-VAR-001 |
| Nested | CR-014-VAR-001-VAR-001 |

### 9A.5 Scope Handoff

When a VAR is created from a failed execution item, it must explicitly specify:
1. What was successfully accomplished in the parent (before the variance)
2. What the VAR absorbs (takes responsibility for)
3. Confirmation that no scope items were lost in the handoff

If scope is reduced (something from the original plan will not be done), this must be explicitly stated and justified.

## 10. Post-Review Requirements

Per SOP-002 Section 7.3, a document may only be routed for post-review when:

1. **Execution Complete:** All execution items have Task Outcome of Pass, or Fail outcomes are documented via VAR (for non-test) or ER (for test documents)
2. **Blocking VARs Resolved:** All Type 1 VARs must be fully closed; Type 2 VARs must be at least pre-approved
3. **Documentation Approved:** Any controlled documents modified under the executable document are EFFECTIVE
4. **Evidence Documented:** Completion evidence is recorded in the Execution Summary column
